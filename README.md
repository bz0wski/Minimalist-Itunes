Just because i didn't find any free options!

What is Minimalist Itunes?
Minimalist Itunes is an unobtrusive little app that resides only in the
menubar and gives information on the currently playing song in iTunes.
It disappears leaving just an icon when iTunes isn’t playing any music.
Hover your mouse pointer over the icon/scrolling text and you’re
presented with a bubble that contains more details on the currently
playing song in iTunes (Album Art, Star Rating, Song length, etc... )
Minimalist Itunes is nothing like any other iTunes music controller on
the internet, give it a spin you won’t regret it.
Spotify and French language support coming soon.

How does Minimalist Itunes work?
Simple, single “left” click on the app icon in the menubar plays/pauses
the current song in iTunes, if iTunes is open.
A double tap of the trackpad/mouse skips the current song whereas a
triple tap goes to the previous song. No complex buttons to meddle with.
A right click(in the traditional sense) or two finger tap on the
trackpad brings up the menu where you access the preferences,go to
rapgenius.com to see the lyrics of the current song or quit the app.
The lyric fetching is a little patchy and hit or mis at the moment but
I’ll get around to fixing it soon. On the preferences panel you can set
up the scroll speed and configure whether or not you want Minimalist
Itunes to launch at start up.

PS: If you have difficulty opening the app, i.e you get a message
telling you can’t open the app because it’s from an unidentified
developer, chances are that you have gatekeeper turned on.
Go to the system preferences app, then select Security&Privacy, then
inside Security&Privacy select the General tab. Click the little
padlock sign at the bottom left of the screen, enter your admin
password then under the gatekeeper options check the “Anywhere” option.
You may now proceed to open Minimalist Itunes without any problems.
Remember to revert Gatekeeper to your preferred option.

RapGenius is the internet’s largest database of current music lyrics,
it may not contain lyrics some very old songs or some foreign songs.
Support for that is coming soon.
Minimalist Itunes is still in very early pre release alpha, feel free
